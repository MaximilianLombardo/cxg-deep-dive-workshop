CZ CELLxGENE Data Portal: Collections Page

### Collections
CZ CELLxGENE Discover is optimized for finding, exploring, and reusing single cell data that adhere to a standard [schema](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/blob/main/schema/3.0.0/schema.md) that facilitates intuitive exploration and integration. The Collections Page lists the collections[^collections_note] hosted on CELLxGENE Discover and metadata that define the tissue, assay, disease, organism, and cell count for each collection. You can reach the collections page by navigating to [https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections) or by navigating to the left hand side of the page header and making sure that the collections page is selected.



[^collections_note]: i.e. collections of datasets associated with a particular publication or consortia effort

<font size="3" > Select the Collections page to explore datasets by their associated publication or consortia group. </font>
:::



Collections represent groups of datasets, typically associated with either a publication or a particular consortia and are displayed as rows in a table on the center of the Collections Page. In each row, we view collection metadtata which includes the collection title (a.k.a. publication title or consortia dataset title), publication reference, the tissue(s), disease state(s), and organism profiled in the collection.

```{margin} Pro Tip
Hover over disease, tissue, and organism fields to expand the list when multiple categories (i.e. '4 tissues') of any field are present
```

Collections are groups of datasets that are associated with particular publication or consortia effort. On the collections page, they are presented in a table with metadata such as Tissue, Disease, Assay, to help you gain a quick understanding of the Collection.

### Datasets

:::{figure-md} markdown-fig
<img src="images/datasets/datasets.png" alt="collections" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="900px">

A nearly identical view is available for individual datasets. In addition to useful metadata fields, you also get information on the associated collection of a dataset and the ability to either download or explore it.

### Filtering Collections


:::{figure-md} markdown-fig
<img src="images/collections/filters.png" alt="collections" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="300px">

Filters are located on the left-hand sidebar to allow you refine your search for Collections.
:::

#### Categorical filters

:::{figure-md} markdown-fig
<img src="images/collections/categoricalFilter.png" alt="collections" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="300px">

Some filters enable a categorical selection (i.e. you can make a search for all 10X related technologies by selecting all of the 10X entries in the dropdown filter).
:::


#### Ontology based filters

:::{figure-md} markdown-fig
<img src="images/collections/ontologyFilter.png" alt="collections" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="900px">

Metadata filters that are associated with an ontology (such as cell tye and tissue) are represented as a simplified hierarchy, curated by our team.
:::

### Filtering Datasets

:::{figure-md} markdown-fig
<img src="images/datasets/datasetFilters.png" alt="collections" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="300px">

You can filter datasets using a similar process. The datasets page contains two additional filters based on cell count and gene count
:::

#### Numeric Filters

:::{figure-md} markdown-fig
<img src="images/datasets/numericFilter.png" alt="collections" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="300px">

We can set threshold on gene count using a numberic filter.
