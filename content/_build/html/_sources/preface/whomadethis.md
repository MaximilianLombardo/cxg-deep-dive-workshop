# About CELLxGENE
Chan Zuckerberg CELL by GENE (CZ CELLxGENE) is an open source cell-resolution data publishing and exploratory analysis platform. CZ CELLxGENE empowers scientists to answer questions about the functionality of cells and tissues, and helps scientists publish complex data to enable reuse by cell biologists and computational biologists. Through standardization and integration of published single-cell datasets, we create a database that enables scientists to answer questions about the function of cells in seconds, instead of executing experiments that take years.

## About CZI Science
We build open source software tools to accelerate science and generate more accurate and biologically important sources of data. We fund scientific research worldwide to advance the frontiers of knowledge.
