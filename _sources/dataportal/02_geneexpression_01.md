# Gene Expression â€” Query Gene Expression Across Tissues

Gene Expression is a tool that allows users to query the expression of any gene across all data in CELLxGENE Discover. A query results in a dot plot per tissue as explained below.

## How to Interpret a Gene Expression Dot Plot

### Dot Plot Basics

A dot plot can reveal gross differences in expression patterns across cell types and highlights genes that are moderately or highly expressed in certain cell types.

Dot plots visualize values across two dimensions: color and size ({numref}`gene-exp-color-scale`). The color of the dot approximates average gene expression. Its size represents the percentage of cells within each cell type that expresses the gene.
