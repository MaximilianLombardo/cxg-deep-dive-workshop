# Understanding how cell types are related using the CL ontology


Cell Guide offers tools to explore relationships between cell types as defined by the UBERON and CL ontologies. Its interactive tree visualization provides a concise and intuitive way to understand hierarchical relationships between cell types and identify areas of opportunity for you research. You can utilize the search bar to look for tissues or cell types.

Try searching for "Heart" to bring up the ontology tree associated with that tissue and its descendants.

As we can see from the resulting visulization, there are many benefits and possibilities that are enabled by Cell Guide:

- Visualize the hierarchy of cell types in the Cell Ontology, gaining insights into cellular classification and organization.
- Understand coverage of cell types and tissues across the CELLxGENE corpus
- Navigate through branches, expand and collapse nodes, and delve into specific cell types to uncover relationships and dependencies.
- Understand the semantic context of cell types by viewing labels, relationships, and neighboring terms within the ontology.
- Use Cell Guide in tandem with Gene Expression. Align single-cell gene expression data with the ontology, enabling comparisons of expression patterns across cell types for discovering gene signatures and inferring functional relationships.

By leveraging Cell Guides, researchers can explore the Cell Ontology, comprehend hierarchical relationships, compare against relevant gene expression data, and advance their understanding of cell types.
